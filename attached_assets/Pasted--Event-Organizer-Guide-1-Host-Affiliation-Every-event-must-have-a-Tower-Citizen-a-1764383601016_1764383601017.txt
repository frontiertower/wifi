# Event Organizer Guide

1. **👥 Host Affiliation**
    
    Every event must have a Tower Citizen as a co-host. You must be directly connected to the event—their startup, art project, charity, etc. You cannot host on behalf of outside groups.
    
2. **⚙️Big Event SOP**
    
    For events with >50 people registered, follow both this guide and our [Big Event SOP](https://www.notion.so/Big-Event-50-people-registered-Organizer-Guide-2a71d81a582080c1af2eefb7e6244017?pvs=21).
    
3. **📅 Calendar & App**
    
    All events must be created through the FrontierTower app and listed on the official lu.ma calendar. If it’s not in the calendar, it cannot take place.
    
4. **🙋 Host Presence & Responsibility**
    
    As the host, you are fully responsible for the event. You must attend, be present at the start, and remain until the event is finished.
    
5. **📣 Marketing & Visibility**
    
    In all promotion—flyers, emails, and every social media post—FrontierTower must be listed as a **co-host**. Always tag FrontierTower in posts.
    
6. **🧹 Cleanup Policy**
    
    You must clean up **immediately after your event**—not the next day, not later in the week. If your event ends very late and the space is not booked the following morning, you may request an exception at [**support@frontiertower.io**](mailto:support@frontiertower.io). $500 cleaning fee otherwise.
    
7. **💸 Tower Share of Earnings**
    
    20% of all revenue (tickets, sponsorships, etc.) goes to the Tower. For lu.ma-hosted events, this share is automatically collected, and you receive your distribution (minus 20%) weekly. Large sums can be paid out earlier upon request. For other income, you are responsible for paying the Tower directly.
    
8. **🏢 Community Floor Liaison**
    
    If you host an event on the floor of your community—or in a floor where you hold an affiliation—you must **liaise with the floor leads upfront**. If there is a conflict with an existing event and the floor leads veto, your event may be cancelled.
    
9. **🍕Selling food or drink is prohibited** unless you have a licensed vendor. Free food and drink at your event.
10. **💊Illegal drugs are strictly prohibited** anywhere in the tower at any time. 
11. **👦Minors**. Minors are not allowed at events past 10pm.
12. **💨Fog machines are not allowed.** $1000 fine if the smoke alarm is set off.
13. **🚫 Prohibited Events.** Events that are political PR, harmful, illegal, discriminatory, or otherwise damaging to the Tower’s reputation are strictly disallowed. FrontierTower reserves the right to cancel any event that violates this principle.  Big Event (>50 people registered) Organizer Guide
