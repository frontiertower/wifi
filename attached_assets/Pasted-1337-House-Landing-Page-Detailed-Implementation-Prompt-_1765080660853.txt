1337 House Landing Page - Detailed Implementation Prompt
Project Overview
Create a vibey, NeuBrutalist-style landing page for "1337 House" - an exclusive co-living space in Alamo Square, San Francisco for founders in top VC programs and PhD students from elite universities. The site should feel authentic, cool, and down-to-earth while maintaining an air of exclusivity.

Target: Founders in YC/a16z/Sequoia programs, Stanford/Berkeley/Harvard PhD students
Mission: Create serendipitous collisions between the brightest technical minds
Design System: NeuBrutalism + ACEternity
