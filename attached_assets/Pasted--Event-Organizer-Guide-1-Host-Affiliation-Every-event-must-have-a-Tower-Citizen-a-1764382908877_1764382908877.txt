# Event Organizer Guide

1. **👥 Host Affiliation**
    
    Every event must have a Tower Citizen as a co-host. You must be directly connected to the event—their startup, art project, charity, etc. You cannot host on behalf of outside groups.
    
2. **⚙️Big Event SOP**
    
    For events with >50 people registered, follow both this guide and our [Big Event SOP](https://www.notion.so/Big-Event-50-people-registered-Organizer-Guide-2a71d81a582080c1af2eefb7e6244017?pvs=21).
    
3. **📅 Calendar & App**
    
    All events must be created through the FrontierTower app and listed on the official lu.ma calendar. If it’s not in the calendar, it cannot take place.
    
4. **🙋 Host Presence & Responsibility**
    
    As the host, you are fully responsible for the event. You must attend, be present at the start, and remain until the event is finished.
    
5. **📣 Marketing & Visibility**
    
    In all promotion—flyers, emails, and every social media post—FrontierTower must be listed as a **co-host**. Always tag FrontierTower in posts.
    
6. **🧹 Cleanup Policy**
    
    You must clean up **immediately after your event**—not the next day, not later in the week. If your event ends very late and the space is not booked the following morning, you may request an exception at [**support@frontiertower.io**](mailto:support@frontiertower.io). $500 cleaning fee otherwise.
    
7. **💸 Tower Share of Earnings**
    
    20% of all revenue (tickets, sponsorships, etc.) goes to the Tower. For lu.ma-hosted events, this share is automatically collected, and you receive your distribution (minus 20%) weekly. Large sums can be paid out earlier upon request. For other income, you are responsible for paying the Tower directly.
    
8. **🏢 Community Floor Liaison**
    
    If you host an event on the floor of your community—or in a floor where you hold an affiliation—you must **liaise with the floor leads upfront**. If there is a conflict with an existing event and the floor leads veto, your event may be cancelled.
    
9. **🍕Selling food or drink is prohibited** unless you have a licensed vendor. Free food and drink at your event.
10. **💊Illegal drugs are strictly prohibited** anywhere in the tower at any time. 
11. **👦Minors**. Minors are not allowed at events past 10pm.
12. **💨Fog machines are not allowed.** $1000 fine if the smoke alarm is set off.
13. **🚫 Prohibited Events.** Events that are political PR, harmful, illegal, discriminatory, or otherwise damaging to the Tower’s reputation are strictly disallowed. FrontierTower reserves the right to cancel any event that violates this principle.
