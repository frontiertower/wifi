Ah, understood! My apologies. We're shifting from a "glowing terminal screen" to the actual **"blueprint document"** itself. This means moving away from the green monochrome and towards a classic blueprint aesthetic with white lines on a dark blue background, or dark lines on a faded light background.

Let's refine the entire website design with a **Blueprint Aesthetic**, reminiscent of detailed technical drawings, but still retaining that 50s/60s retro-futuristic charm and the Pip-Boy's robust functionality.

### **Frontier Tower Blueprints: Full Website Redesign**

**Core Visuals & Interactions:**
* **Dominant Color Scheme:**
    * **"Classic Blueprint" style:** White/light grey lines and text on a deep, dark blueprint blue background. Accents of faded sepia tones or light grey for backgrounds on "paper" sections.
    * **Alternatively ("Light Blueprint"):** Dark blue or black lines and text on a faded, off-white, or light tan "blueprint paper" background.
* **Textures:** Rolled blueprint paper textures (subtle creases, faded edges), drafting table wood, metal drafting tools, subtle pencil/ink line variations.
* **Typography:**
    * **Headers:** Clean, bold sans-serif, mimicking architectural drawing titles (e.g., "Architects' Daughter" or a similar hand-drawn technical font, or a very clean geometric sans).
    * **Body Text:** A clear, slightly monospace or condensed sans-serif, simulating annotation text on a drawing.
    * **Labels:** Small, precise, capitalized, often with arrows or dashed lines pointing to elements.
* **Animations:**
    * **Page Transitions:** Smooth "unrolling" of a blueprint, or a quick "fade-in" like a print developing.
    * **Elements:** Subtle "hand-drawn" animation for lines appearing, text "stamping" onto the page, elements highlighting with a faint glow or hatch pattern on hover.

### **Button Styles: "Technical Controls"**

Buttons will look like part of the blueprint itself, or sturdy, labeled physical controls from a drafting machine.

1.  **Primary Call-to-Action (e.g., "INITIATE APPLICATION PROTOCOL", "ACCESS PROJECT OVERVIEW")**
    * **Appearance:** Looks like a physical, labeled push-button from a drafting console, or a section of the blueprint highlighted with a thick, bold border and a "STAMP" effect. Could be a subtle metallic sheen with the blueprint text.
    * **Text:** Bold, capitalized sans-serif, in a contrasting color (e.g., dark blue on a light background, or white on a dark blue background).
    * **Hover:** The button subtly "depresses," a hatch pattern fills the background, or a glow appears around the border, as if activated. Subtle sound effect like a mechanical click.
    * **Click:** Clearly "depressed" with a satisfying thunk.

2.  **Secondary Call-to-Action (e.g., "REVIEW SPECIFICATIONS", "ACCESS ARCHIVES")**
    * **Appearance:** A clean, rectangular outline on the blueprint, with text inside. Or a simple underlined text link that resembles a hand-drawn annotation highlight.
    * **Text:** Sans-serif, matching the blueprint's main text color. May include a small arrow or schematic icon.
    * **Hover:** The outline thickens, text brightens, or a faint crosshatch pattern appears in the background.

3.  **Navigation Links (Header/Footer)**
    * **Appearance:** Text only, precisely drawn, perhaps with a small dot or dash preceding it.
    * **Hover:** Text brightens, a small ">" mark appears, or a clean, thin rectangle highlights the text.
