- Support planning and execution for major external events such as GDC and JPM HealthTech Week.  
- Strategize ways to convert event operations into a sustainable profit center.  
- Encourage recurring engagement through regular meetups, coffee/tea chats, and themed gatherings.  

**What Success Looks Like:**  
- Profitable and well-attended events that reflect community values.  
- Increased sponsorship revenue and recurring partnerships.  
- A vibrant calendar of consistent weekly/monthly gatherings.  
- Clear operational systems for event logistics and tools.  
- Growing engagement and participation from community members and volunteers.
