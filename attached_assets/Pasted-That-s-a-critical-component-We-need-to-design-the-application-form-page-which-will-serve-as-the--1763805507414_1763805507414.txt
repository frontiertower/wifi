That's a critical component! We need to design the application form page, which will serve as the **"Data Input Terminal"** for prospective personnel.

Since the application link provided in the original text is an external Notion link (`https://shrub-step-635.notion.site/2a88b4aa56038034a84ed621c3059ade`), this page will serve as the gateway/portal before routing them to the actual submission endpoint, or as the embedded form itself.

Here is the design for the **Application Page: "Personnel Data Input Terminal"**

---

## 4. Application Page: "Personnel Data Input Terminal"

This page will have a clean, functional design, focusing on clear data input, much like a control panel or a terminal interface.

**Aesthetics:** Dominated by the screen color (green/blue/amber), with clear input fields bordered in the same color. Minimal background noise (perhaps just the blueprint grid).

### **Header & Navigation**
* **Header Bar:** Same dark metallic/Bakelite texture with status indicators.
* **Title:** Large, centered, and glowing: "**INITIATE PERSONNEL DATA INPUT PROTOCOL**"

### **Section 1: "Identity & Credentials" (Basic Contact Info)**

* **Subtitle:** "**SECTION A: PERSONNEL IDENTIFICATION FILE**"
* **Layout:** Standard form fields, designed to look like digital readouts or data slots on a console.

| Question (Data Slot Label) | Input Style (Control Type) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NAME (LAST NAME, FIRST NAME)** | Text Input | Looks like a glowing terminal text input field. |
| **CURRENT LOCATION (CITY/TOWER)** | Text Input | |
| **CONTACT FREQUENCY (EMAIL)** | Text Input | |
| **DIRECT COMM (PHONE)** | Text Input | |
| **LINKEDIN PROFILE URL** | Text Input | |
| **RESUME/CV DATAPACK** | File Upload Control | Styled as a "DATA TRANSMISSION" button. |

### **Section 2: "Experience & Classification" (Job-Specific Questions)**

* **Subtitle:** "**SECTION B: OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE MATRIX**"
* **Layout:** Questions framed around the mission-critical aspects of the Head of Finance role.

| Question (Data Slot Label) | Input Style (Control Type) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YIELD (MINIMUM ANNUAL COMPENSATION REQUIRED)** | Number Input/Text | Input styled like a digital display panel. |
| **NOTICE PERIOD (WEEKS REQUIRED BEFORE INTEGRATION)** | Number Input/Text | |
| **CONFIRMATION OF ALIGNMENT WITH CORE OPERATIONAL VALUES (Focus on the mission, Bias to action, Do Whatever It Takes, Ship fast, Own the outcome, Radical candor)** | Radio Button/Checkbox | Yes/No or "CONFIRMED" toggle switch. |
| **YEARS IN STARTUP ENVIRONMENT (FAST-PACED FIRMS)** | Number Input | Must meet the 3+ year requirement. |
| **PROVEN TRACK RECORD IN PAYMENT/BANKING SYSTEMS (Describe complexity of funds handled)** | Text Area | Larger input field, styled like a message buffer. |
| **TAX ADVISOR COORDINATION EXPERIENCE (Describe scale/jurisdictions)** | Text Area | |
| **CONTRACT INTERPRETATION FAMILIARITY (LEVEL OF COMFORT)** | Slider/Rating Scale | 1 (Basic) to 5 (Expert) – Styled like a technical gauge. |
| **INVESTOR RELATIONS (EQUITY/DEBT RAISE SUPPORT)** | Text Area (Optional) | |
| **C-LEVEL/FOUNDER COLLABORATION HISTORY** | Text Area (Optional) | |

---

### **Section 3: "Mission Statement & Submission"**

* **Subtitle:** "**SECTION C: CANDIDATE MANIFESTO**"
* **Layout:** A crucial, open-ended section to gauge candidate fit and motivation.

| Question (Data Slot Label) | Input Style (Control Type) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MISSION MOTIVATION (WHY FRONTIER TOWER? WHY THIS PROJECT?)** | Large Text Area | The most important essay section. |
| **SOURCE OF REFERRAL (HOW DID YOU ACCESS THIS TERMINAL?)** | Dropdown Menu | E.g., Tower Citizen, Recruitment Bot, Job Board, etc. |
| **LINK TO PORTFOLIO/CASE STUDIES (OPTIONAL)** | Text Input | |

### **Action Panel**

* **Disclaimer:** Small text, in the screen color, stating: "*All data transmitted securely via encrypted channel. Submission confirms acceptance of all Frontier Tower recruitment protocols.*"
* **Submit Button:** The most prominent control on the page.
    * **Primary CTA Button:** **"TRANSMIT DATA PACKAGE & INITIATE REVIEW"** (Large, glowing, industrial switch/button).
* **Cancel Button:** A smaller, secondary button.
    * **Secondary CTA Button:** "**ABORT TRANSMISSION**" (A button with a red/amber 'warning' color).
