# **Head of Finance @ Frontier Tower (Remote or Hybrid)**

## **Join us at Frontier Tower**

We are the world’s fastest-growing network society. Our capital is San Francisco, and our citadel is a 16-story vertical village for frontier tech, arts & music on Market Street. Our mission is to design a governance model that is flexible and organic enough for communities worldwide to adopt and join. We are building a true federation where each tower retains its own rules while benefiting from the joined economic layer, portable citizenship rights and tech infrastructure. Our goals are bold: 9 additional towers by the end of 2026 and 100 towers by 2029. We’re growing double-digit % MOM while building the technological backbone to govern the next era of society in a post-labor world. We are backed by leading visionaries and will raise a major round for a DAO next year. Ultimately, we aim to unite 10 million frontier citizens in a seamless inter-city network society. To scale this fast, we need the right tools: Imagine rebuilding nation-state governance from the ground up—with AI native to the system next to an App Store for governance, plug-and-play community Apps, and built-in payments with our own currency powering a new frontier economy.

## **Why us?**

- **Frontier Tech only:** Work at the bleeding edge of innovation. Nothing is too new, every thought can be challenged, and the status quo is there to be disrupted
- **Crypto Native:** Decentralization, permissionlessness & censorship resistance is what we breath. ****Think of the first names that come to mind in crypto whose identity is known: Those are our seed investors. Imagine societies of tomorrow: sovereign networks that transcend borders and nation-states: That’s where we operate.
- **Momentum but Early Stage:** Our first 16-floor installation is already crowded with frontier citizens, the second a 112 bedroom residency is opening in December, yet we’re barely seven months in and there is plenty of space to engrave your initials into the ground.

## **The Role**

This is a remote-first job. You'll be our head of finance, overseeing multiple companies which are either holding real estate, operating companies, or working on creating the tech which runs it all. You’ll be operating all bank accounts, paying the team and vendors, speaking to tax advisors and preparing financials for our investors. You’ll be working closely with the CEO to make sure that new contracts are signed and that we don’t miss any important deadlines. You will work on financial models and support in the fundraise by engaging with investors who have committed to investing or have already signed the paperwork and need assistance to wire the funds.
